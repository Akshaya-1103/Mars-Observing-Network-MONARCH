# Mars-Observing-Network-MONARCH
This repository contains the mission breakdown and key documentation for the **Mars Observing Network for Atmospheric Research and Characterization (MONARCH)**, focusing on Martian weather monitoring for future human exploration.
## Mission Objectives
- Assess the atmospheric state affecting orbital capture and EDL for human-scale Mars missions.
- Characterize landing-site environments for safe landings.
- Provide climatological analysis of dust storm activity to support human exploration.
## Key Features
- **Telemetry and Telecommand** (TTMTC) subsystems for orbiter, lander, and rover communications.
- **Atmospheric Data Analysis** for weather forecasting and dust storm monitoring.
- **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)** systems for accurate Mars mission trajectories.
